## Wind turbines tracker

Web app locating wind turbines in Alaska. Users can find
detailed information about each wind turbine by clicking on the icon on the map. The map title includes an overview of all the wind turbines in the region.

You can check out the project [**HERE**](https://alaska-wind-turbines.netlify.app/ 'Completed project').

### Motivation

I have always loved working with maps, and I wanted to make a project using Google Maps API. I searched for interesting data to build my app around, and found wind turbines data from [U.S. Geological Survey API](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/apis 'U.S. Geological Survey API homepage').

### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
- **SCSS**
- **React Google Maps API** to integrate Google Maps JavaScript API with React

### Challenges:

Initially, the main obstacle was to find data which included geographical coordinates, and was interesting to work with as well. Later on, I realized there was a lot of missing values in the data set I chose. I had to start filling in the gaps with
randomly generated numbers to make the app look more
presentable.

This was the first bigger React project I had done, and that brought up many challenges in itself. Integrating React with Google Maps API was the main one. I had a difficult time finding exactly what I needed from the extensive Google Maps API documentation.

Also, I did not really know how to exactly implement most of the things in React. I started to focus on smaller sections of the demo code to get a better understanding what is going on, and eventually it started to make more sense.
